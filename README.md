Supplementary material to the chapter "Boolean networks and their dynamics: the impact of updates" by
Loïc Paulevé and Sylvain Sené (in press).

These notebooks demonstate how to use the Python module
[`colomoto.minibn`](https://github.com/colomoto/colomoto-jupyter) for computing
dynamics of Boolean networks with various updating modes.

They can be visualized online at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pauleve/updating-modes-notebooks/

They can be executed and modified online at XXX

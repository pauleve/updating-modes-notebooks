Supplementary material to the chapter "Boolean networks and their dynamics: the impact of updates" by
Loïc Paulevé and Sylvain Sené (in press).

These notebooks demonstate how to use the Python module
`colomoto.minibn` for computing dynamics of Boolean networks with
various updating modes.

They can be visualized online at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pauleve/updating-modes-notebooks/

TODO: instruction to run them, including mybinder link
